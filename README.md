## About

Since AngularJS modules cannot be used directly in Qlik Sense visualization extensions, this is a **_growing_** collection of AngularJS directives I use in some of the visualizations I develop and should also give some help how to create AngularJS directives which can be used in Qlik Sense.

**Feel free to contribute to this repository.**

More information about how to use AngularJS in Qlik Sense visualization extensions can be found here:
